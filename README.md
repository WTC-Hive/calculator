# Calculator CLI App

Welcome to the Calculator CLI App project! In this project, you will implement a command-line calculator with basic and advanced mathematical functions. A basic, yet powerful calculator app built using Python. This project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and loops. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and more.

## Instructions

## Project Extension

In a few days, we will extend this project to create a mobile app using **Flet**. Stay tuned for updates!

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:  
```bash
pytest tests/test_calculator_functions.py
```

## Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

#### Important Notes

    - Only submissions from branches named after the student (e.g., john-doe) will be accepted.

    - Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

    - If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help!
